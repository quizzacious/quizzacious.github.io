## Community Feedback

"As much as possible, present all information on the page without needing to scroll. Default text instructions on 'Edit Profile' page so users know what to fill the information with (e.g for Image: paste a url to your designated image). Hitting back after going to the profile page leads to a blank page unless you reload." - Raymond Quinones

"Good and colorful design but the text font can be difficult to read. There are some troubles with making a quiz, and making a profile should have optional fields. After finishing taking a quiz it keep going back to the begin this quiz, it should instead go back to all the different quizzes instead." - Rufina Wasserman

"When taking someone else's quizzes, there are slight confusing issues with how the answer selection is set up. I feel that it shouldn't have a green check mark next to it. As it can be confusing to the participant on whether that is their answer they are selecting and whether or not it is automatically graded and states if its correct or not. Other than that, the format and each individual page is clean and legible. I enjoy the aesthetic to the site. There are minor changes that can be easily resolved or changed. So great job on the website!" - Dylan Henke

"The website is very straight forward. I'm unsure what ratings are. The save button and next button should have the same functionality. Its amazing that I can see other people's quizzes too. Profiles are a nice thing to see by clicking on other user links. There is no done button at the end of the quiz and dont know which questions I got right/wrong." - David Kimura
